This package was created by [Essam Wisam](https://github.com/JuliaAI) under supervision and expert guidance from his mentor [Dr. Anthony Blaom](https://github.com/ablaom). Additionally, [Dr. Rik Huijzer](https://github.com/rikhuijzer) and his binary `SMOTE` implementation in `Resample.jl` have also been helpful while starting this project.
