This package was created by [Essam Wisam](https://github.com/JuliaAI) as a Google Summer of Code project, under the mentorship of [Anthony Blaom](https://ablaom.github.io). Special thanks also go to [Rik Huijzer](https://github.com/rikhuijzer) for his friendliness and the binary `SMOTE` implementation in `Resample.jl`.
