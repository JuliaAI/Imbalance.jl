"""
This files defines the `generic_oversample` function which is used by all the oversampling methods.
"""

"""
This function is a generic implementation of oversampling methods that apply oversampling
logic independently to each class.

# Arguments
- `X::AbstractMatrix`: A matrix or table where each row is an observation of floats
- `y::AbstractVector`: An abstract vector of class labels
- `oversample_per_class`: A function that takes a matrix of observations, a number
    of new observations to generate, and possibly other keyword arguments and 
    returns a matrix where each row is a new observation generated by the oversampling method
$DOC_RATIOS_ARGUMENT
- `kwargs`: Keyword arguments to pass to `oversample_per_class`

# Returns
- `Xover`: A matrix that includes the original observations and the 
    new observations generated by the oversampling method for each class.
- `yover`: An abstract vector of class labels that includes the original labels and the 
    new labels generated by the oversampling method for each class.
